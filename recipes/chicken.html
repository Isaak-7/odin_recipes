    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Try this and you'll know why they call it saltimbocca--Italian for 'jump
      in your mouth.' It's kind of like it jumps right off of your plate. Though
      it's traditionally made with veal, I made it with chicken. Quick, easy,
      and so delicious!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 (6 ounce) chicken cutlets</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>16 large fresh sage leaves</li>
      <li>16 thin slices prosciutto</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>½ stick butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If cutlets are thick, lay them between 2 sheets of wax paper and pound
        to 1/2-inch thickness with flat side of a meat mallet or bottom of a
        small, heavy skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 4
        cutlets and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run
        clear, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter; tent with foil
        to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and remaining
        4 cutlets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add wine to skillet and simmer, scraping up any browned bits, 1 minute.
        Add broth and simmer until slightly reduced, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from
        heat, add butter, and swirl skillet until butter has melted and sauce is
        creamy. Spoon 2 tablespoons sauce over each cutlet and serve.
